SIM fast gives quick and easy access to your phone model, IMEI, IMSI, SIM etc.

Have you ever feel embarrassed when calling your support professional for assistance and when asking for your phone model or IMEI and you have no idea of what it is or where to get that information from?

SIM fast aggregate the most common parameters your support professional is likely to ask you when calling for assistance.

SIM fast gives you quick and easy access to:

	- Phone model
	- IMEI
	- IMSI
	- SIM serial number
	- Network carrier name you are connected to
	      ...       

The idea of this app came after I called my carrier for support and discover that some Android device manufacturers doe not respect the standard Android layout menu setting. I was expecting to see IMEI at one place and it was not. worse, the information related to the SIM was in a completely different menu section.

I first develop this app for my own needs then I decide to share it with the Android community.

It is really a "no frills" app and was designed only for the reason mention above (not for pulling valuable information from you phone).

In respect to your rights for privacy, this app has NO adds and only require the minimum access needed to fulfill its duty, you can use it in complete confidence.
